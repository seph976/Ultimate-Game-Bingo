# Ultimate Game Bingo

This is the continuation of my Ocarina of Time bingo board that i made a while back, i decided to remake the project from scratch to make it an online
lockout board and to make it possible to support multiple games.

Currently it supports Ocarina of Time and Chrono Trigger, but more games will be added soon.

All games can be played in either grid mode or hex mode with duplicate items on the board enabled or disabled, however games will also have
their own settings depending on what you want on the board.

For now the board only supposed lockout mode when you play multiplayer, however you can easily open two boards and join eachother as a spectator if you
want to play normal mode and keep track of eachothers boards, note that you can also play alone by just opening a room on your own.
